# Next.js 15 Unexpected Rendering Error

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug that can occur in Next.js 15 applications when variables are declared and used within functional components without being explicitly returned or included in the rendered JSX. Next.js 15, leveraging the latest React features, enforces stricter rendering behavior, which can lead to unexpected errors if not handled carefully.

## Bug Description

The bug manifests when a variable is declared and used inside a component's JSX but is not part of the component's return value.  In older versions of Next.js, this might not have caused an issue, but with Next.js 15's updated React integration and strict rendering process, it results in a runtime error.  The error can be difficult to track down because it isn't immediately obvious from the code itself.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the `/about` page.  You'll see the error in the console, revealing the unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that all variables used in the JSX are explicitly returned as part of the component's output. This ensures that React's reconciliation process correctly handles all values used in rendering.

## Additional Notes

This issue highlights the importance of understanding how React's rendering process works, especially with the stricter rules enforced by Next.js 15. Careful attention to variable scope and ensuring all data used in the JSX is explicitly returned is crucial for avoiding unexpected errors.
