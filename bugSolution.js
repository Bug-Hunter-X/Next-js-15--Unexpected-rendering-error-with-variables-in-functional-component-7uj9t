```javascript
// pages/about.js

export default function About() {
  const myVariable = 10;
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Page</h1>
      <p>This is the about page.</p>
      <p>The value of myVariable is: {myVariable}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
The solution is straightforward: make sure that any variable used within the JSX is included in the component's `return` statement.  This ensures that the variable is properly included in the component's rendered output and avoids the unexpected error.
